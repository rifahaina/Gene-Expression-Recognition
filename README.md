## 🎯 Project Goal

This project aims to develop an end-to-end artificial intelligence and machine learning pipeline to identify biologically meaningful gene expression patterns from RNA-seq data. Using public datasets such as GEO and TCGA, the project focuses on discovering expression-based clusters, molecular signatures, and disease-associated groups through systematic data preprocessing, modelling, and interpretation.

The project integrates RNA-seq quality control and normalisation, exploratory data analysis, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, biological interpretation, explainable AI, and deployment of a lightweight Streamlit application for result demonstration.

- Build supervised machine learning models for expression-based classification
- Identify potential biomarkers and interpret results using GO/KEGG analysis
- Apply explainable AI methods to interpret machine learning predictions
- Deploy a lightweight web-based application for interactive analysis
