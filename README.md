# Gene-Expression-Recognition
This project applies AI and machine learning to analyse gene expression patterns from public RNA-seq datasets (e.g. GEO, TCGA). Interns will perform RNA-seq preprocessing, normalisation, visualisation, ML modelling, and biological interpretation to identify expression clusters and disease-associated signatures.
